# My First Token Generation

Welcome to the Token Generation Example repository! This repository showcases the process of token creation and presents a robust method for authenticating systems and APIs using tokens. Developers looking to implement token-based authentication in their applications can benefit from this codebase, which follows best practices and serves as a solid starting point.

## Overview

Token generation involves building a digital asset on a blockchain network. This is achieved through the utilization of mappings to define three key public variables: `token full name`, `abbreviated form (abbrev.)`, and `overall supply`. By employing mappings, efficient data access and retrieval are ensured. These variables represent the complete name of the token, its abbreviation, and the maximum supply. This approach offers transparency and adaptability, enhancing the management of the token within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Executing the Program

The token generation contract features three essential public variables:

- `tokenName`: This variable, represented as a string, signifies the designated name of the token.
- `tokenAbbrv`: Similarly, this string variable denotes the associated abbreviation of the token.
- `totalSupply`: Lastly, an unsigned integer that indicates the overall volume of available tokens.

These public variables play a pivotal role in defining and distinguishing the token within the contract, facilitating effective administration and interaction with the token across its lifecycle.

## Mapping Mechanism

The contract incorporates the `balances` mapping, which streamlines the storage and retrieval of token balances tied to specific addresses. This architecture ensures seamless tracking of ownership and enables secure transactions within the blockchain environment.

## Token Generation

The contract introduces the `mint` function, designed to expand the total supply by a specified amount and correspondingly augment the balance of a given address. This mechanism simplifies the creation of new tokens while maintaining accurate records of the total supply and individual balances.

## Token Removal

To enable controlled token removal, the contract integrates a `burn` function. This function is responsible for subtracting a designated amount from both the total supply and the balance associated with a provided address. This systematic reduction in supply and balance permits the controlled elimination of tokens while upholding precise records within the contract.
